# Decision Models

# AHP implementation in Python and NumPy

Implement the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a Python program.

Requests:

1. The input for the program is represented by a set of text files (CSV format) containing
    pairwise comparison matrices for criteria and alternatives for each criterion.
2. Additional input is represented by AHP parameters like RCI table, threshold for consistency,
    etc.
3. The output of the program is represented by all the results (final and intermediate) offered by
    the AHP.
4. The program must be interactive for the end-user, thus it should ask for file names and input
    parameters, communicate the consistency, ask to change pairwise comparison matrices,
    provide results on the standard output, etc.
5. The program must work with any number of criteria and alternatives.
6. The program must be organized in Python functions.

## Test cases

Provide also two sets of input (files and other info) to test your program:

1. The same example reported in the slides discussed during the online lecture.
2. The same example you have already implemented by using Microsoft Excel (assigned during
    lecture 06).

In at least one of the above test cases, please demonstrate that the consistency check works well.
Provide also a text document in which all the steps to execute your code are described in details and
the test cases are explained and documented (e.g., draw the hierarchy).

## Python tools

- Use NumPy to handle all vector-based structures and operations.
- Use Spyder (in the Anaconda package) to write the program. You must create a Spyder
    Project.

## Submission

- Send the solution files (in the Spyder Project â€“ including the text document) to the teacher by
    using Microsoft Teams (Activity).

# Happy coding!
